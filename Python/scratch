        Construction: If AB and CD are intersecting, then the intersection point can be given
        in 2-barycentric coordinates on the segment CD. Since barycentric coordinates are invariant
        under projections, take the absolute lengths of the projections of C and D onto the normal of AB,
        which can be obtained by taking the absolute value of the dot product of A->C and A->D onto
        a normalized normal of AB.
